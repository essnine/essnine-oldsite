    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    
    <p>
      I am Suraj Zala. I code in primarily in Python, but have a base level of experience in Bash, JS, and C++.
      I've dabbled in PWAs built with Ionic in college, and have generally done a fair bit of server setup on Linux machines.

      This is a basic website.
      I do know some front-end work, but I'm not very keen on form before function.
