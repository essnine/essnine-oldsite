          Hi there!
          <br /><br />
          My name's Suraj. I've been working primarily with Python since mid-2018, but have an intermediate level of experience in Bash and JS, and base experience in C++.<br />
          I've dabbled in PWAs built with Ionic in college, and have generally done a fair bit of server setup on Linux machines.<br />
          <br /><br />
          I like working on backend services. Over the past few years, I've worked on:
          <div class="flex-item">
            <ul>
              <li>a real-time customer service chat backend using socketio</li>
              <li>an enterprise chatbot solution built on the same backend</li>
              <li>NLP management functionalities built on top of services like DialogFlow</li>
              <li>generic RESTful APIs on Flask and Django</li>
              <li>automating/scheduling tasks with cron</li>
              <li>basic CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins</li>
              <li>general utilties using bash scripting</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          This list will keep expanding as time passes. I don't have a lot more to say about me professionally.<br />
          In the meantime, if you'd like to know more about me, I blog <a href="https://blog.surajz.codes" target="_blank">here</a>. <br />
          You can also <a href="mailto:surajzala12@gmail.com">write</a> to me.<br />
          Have a good day!
