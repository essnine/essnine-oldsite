          Hi there!
          <br /><br />
          I'm Suraj. I'm a software engineer, primarily working in Python since 2018.
          <br /><br />
          I'm a backend engineer. Over the past few years, I've worked on:
          <div class="flex-item">
            <ul>
              <li>a real-time customer service chat backend using socketio</li>
              <li>an enterprise chatbot solution built on the same backend</li>
              <li>NLP management functionalities built on top of services like DialogFlow</li>
              <li>generic RESTful APIs on Flask, FastAPI and Django</li>
              <li>automating/scheduling tasks with cron, and other linux-y stuff</li>
              <li>more automation retrofitted to an existing large-scale document-processing system</li>
              <li>development and maintenance on a rule-based decision engine for a well-known FinTech corp</li>
              <li>general tinkering with shell, protocols, all sorts of tidbits and tooling</li>
              <li>training and mentoring padawans new to programming professionally</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          
          Besides programming, I like to keep up with tech, read sci-fi, and get excited/feel existential terror about space.
          (Big surprise, right?) I'm trying to learn some Elixir and a bit of Rust, although that's not really going very well.
          But you gotta keep truckin'.

          I also like motorcycles, old-school tech, retro stuff from the early internet, and so on.
          I mean, let me be clear. I love these things. It's an entirely unrelated matter that I somehow
          never manage to have or make enough time for any of these things. But doubt you not my love for them.

          I'm currently stuck in the more orchestral parts of the Halo: Reach OST album. It messes with my head 
          when the weather's all rainy like this.

          (I also tend to have a screwdriver of some sort on me most of the time.)<br /><br />
          In the meantime, if you'd like to know more about me, you can check out my linkedin, or twitter, or something. 
          
          I do sometimes blog <a href="https://essnine.dev/blog" target="_blank">here</a>, <br />
          although I think the site's going to be down for development for a bit.
          And if for some reason, you feel like pinging me the old school way, you can always email me at surajzala12[at]gmail[dot]com.<br /><br />
          Have a good day!
